                            <h3>The Novel's Extra</h3>
                            <p>Billions of characters exist inside the single world of a novel.
                                However, no one aside from the heroines and ‘important supporting characters’ receives a name.
                                “Chundong, what is your standing?”
                                I don’t know. I don’t even know why my name is Chundong.
                                This world is a novel I wrote.
                                However, I ended up as a character I’d never even written about.
                                Other than getting accepted into the Agent Military Academy, this character isn’t particularly extraordinary, has no interactions with anyone in the novel, and isn’t even mentioned at all.
                                Therefore, I became an extra in the novel.
                                …No. I became dust on the novel.</p>

                            <p>Abandoned at birth in a stable, Shirone was raised by commoners.=
                                As a child, he had gifted Insight and had learned how to read. After visiting the city, he finally saw the workings of magic, which he was immensely curious about.
                                This inspired Shirone’s dream of becoming a mage. However, the city was a place with a cruel and rigid social hierarchy. Here, Shirone discovered the hidden side of the world before he even reached adulthood…
                                Will Shirone be able to achieve his dream of becoming a mage in this twisted world?</p>
